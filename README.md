Swagreads is a full-stack, single-page book management application inspired by Goodreads. Users can create bookshelves, shelve books, write book reviews and mark books as read, unread, want-to-read, or currently reading. Swagreads consists of a PostgreSQL database, a Ruby on Rails backend and a React/Redux frontend.
